# Proximo Betaflight Configuration

Will update this document as I think of more places to add things.

## OSD Font / Logo
Due to some bugs in BF Configurator, it was easier to use bflogoreplacer library to embed the logo directly into the default OSD font file.  This is `OSD_FONT.mcm` and is to be uploaded in the Font Manager screen on OSD tab.
